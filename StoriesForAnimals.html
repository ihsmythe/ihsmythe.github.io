            There are literally millions of books written <i>about</i> animals, but only two books written specifically <I>for</I> animals &ndash; and this is one of them.* Originally these stories were published on the wind as an olfactory collection for dogs, but when they soared to #1 on the bestseller lists, other creatures demanded versions for themselves. Thus they were published with vegetable based inks for the edification of rabbits and slugs; converted into a vigorous waggle dance for honeybees; transcribed into whale songs, bird calls, cricket chirps, and elephant trumpets; and, lastly, translated into cow pies for the satisfaction of dung beetles and houseflies. All of these animals enjoyed reading about phobic cats, skeptical basset hounds, heroic honeybees, tree-hugging slugs, and megalomaniacal mollusks &ndash; but now, at long last, <i>Stories for Animals</i> is available to animals of all species &ndash; including yours.
