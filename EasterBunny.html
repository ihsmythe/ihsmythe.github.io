            Of course! With the discovery of the ancient scrolls at Nag Hammadi, we finally know the truth! Happy Easter!

              And there appeared at that time a rabbit, the size of a man, and he did carry a basket of foil eggs on a bed of coloured straw. And seeing the sepulchre where Jesus lay, and it being Easter Sunday, he rolleth away the stone with a mighty heave and put the basket at the head of the Son of Man. Then hoppeth he from the tomb, and he looketh back three times; but rubbing his back and cursing, he decideth not to roll the stone again.
            </P>

              “Who hath rolled the stone away?” the Roman guards did ask when they awoke from their slumber, and asking thus, they decided it was the Jews; and the Jews decided it was the Romans; and the Christ-followers decided it was the Christ; and the children decided it was a large white rabbit, with nose of pink and tail of finest cotton, because they had peeked even when they had been told not to.
            </P>
            <P>
              And when Jesus awoke from death and emerged from the sepulchre the basket was gone. “We don’t know wherein lies the basket,” spaketh the Roman guard; but Jesus had not asked about the basket. “It was the Jews,” spaketh the guard. But even so there was chocolate at one corner of his mouth.
            </P>
            <P>
              Jesus wept.
            </P>
            <P>
              And suddenly there did appear a rectangular box of blue; and the breadth of it was one cubit and one half; and the height of it was five cubits; and entering the blue box, the white rabbit disappeared, and the blue box did likewise.
            </P>
            <P>
              And the children were punished with a rod.
