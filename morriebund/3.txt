Tuesday May 19th
7:21 AM	Am still dead. Exact location in hereafter unknown. Pressing crowd, supplicants, Mother. Surprised not to find self in hell actually...
7:22 AM	...although recall yelling as bus struck &ldquo;I accept Jesus Christ as my personal saviour!&rdquo; to be on safe side. Pascal's wager etc.
7:23 AM	Ahead large throne with glowing bearded figure. Possibly judgment seat of Christ, if Sunday school lessons accurate.
7:24 AM	Feeling tense. Desire not to be cast into everlasting fire growing stronger as queue shortens. Reminded of standing in line to see Santa.
7:25 AM	Mother cuffs ear. No reason.
7:26 AM	Can this be real? Am I dead? I mean honestly DEAD? DEAD dead?
7:27 AM	A bit of a shocker, since never took religion seriously &mdash; assumed minister parroting drivel dreamt up by imbeciles. I mean, come on.
7:27 AM	Now, because of thoughtful nonbelief, may burn for eternity. Bother.
8:31 AM	Grr. Wanted earthly reward, not heavenly variety. Will demand to be sent back! Who's in MY office, MY chair? On whose lap does Judy sit?
8:32 AM	HUBERMAN!!!
8:33 AM	Almost there. Angels, like elves, directing. See others receiving imperishable crowns, trophies. Tempted to climb on lap, ask for secretary.
8:34 AM	30 minute wait from this point.
8:54 AM	Mother now at feet of Christ. Receiving many-jewelled crown, golden crockpot, matching oven mitts and tea cozy sewn from Mary's veil.
8:55 AM	Much praise for the old bitch. Bloody hell. God apparently not watching activities on Earth as advertised.
9:04 AM	My turn to be judged by ... Christ Almighty! Is that a TRAPDOOR in front of throne?!
9:05 AM	Approaching Christ, looks vaguely like Huberman.
9:06 AM	Bowing at feet of Christ, hopefully can't see me texting. Jesus not only God made flesh &mdash; Jesus also God made hair. On toe knuckles.
9:06 AM	Like kneeling at feet of Bilbo.
9:09 AM	Jesus white with brown hair, brown eyes, beard, as in pictures. Shorter in real life. Also clearly male. Feminists 0, televangelists 1.
9:12 AM	Jesus wearing robe, looks like dress to me. In addition to omniscience possible Stephen Fry has more in common with Almighty than suspected.
9:13 AM	(Yes, Stephen Fry gay. I know, I know. Shocking. Have read everything, seen everything he's ever done and never once suspected.)
9:18 AM	Currently receiving lecture. Jesus in pickle. Legally can't send to hell due to last minute &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; but would like to smell burning.
9:59 AM	Lecture continues. Jesus mad as wet hen. I don't think He does love everybody. I don't think He even likes them. Humanity one big headache.
10:27 AM	Recess called while case considered. Still incredulous. Seeing not necessarily believing. Seeing also deceiving. Mirage, beer-goggles etc.
10:28 AM	Which is more likely? That I stand at judgement seat of Christ or that I am insane? Will never know for sure. Trapdoor getting hotter.
4:39 PM	Waiting, waiting. Sweet Hereafter obviously administrative nightmare. Did He anticipate BILLIONS of humans when designing this place?
4:40 PM	Or did He make same blunder as when designing Earth?
