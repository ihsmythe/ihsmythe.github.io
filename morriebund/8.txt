Sunday May 24th
7:18 AM	Bus pulls up to stop, gospel music blaring like ice cream vendor's.
7:19 AM	Door opens, driver says, &ldquo;Hi there, I'm Jehu the son of Nimshi. You might know me from 2nd Kings?&rdquo;
7:19 AM	&ldquo;I don't think so,&rdquo; I reply. &ldquo;A shame,&rdquo; replies Jehu, &ldquo;it's some of God's best material. INSPIRED. Well, it's all inspired really &mdash; &rdquo;
7:20 AM	&ldquo;Anyway, welcome aboard!&rdquo; says Jehu. I sit, then note plaque at front of bus. 2nd Kings 9:20...
7:20 AM	&ldquo;<I>&lsquo;And the driving is like the driving of Jehu, the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.&rsquo;</I> &rdquo;
7:21 AM	Bus takes off like rocket, swerves crazily as if being driven by lunatic, at which point I notice a bloody head in a bucket by Jehu's feet.
7:22 AM	&ldquo;Oh, it's just a reminder of the good old days &mdash; you know &mdash; Biblical times,&rdquo; he replies with a dreamy look when I ask him what the hell's that.
7:22 AM	&ldquo;The slaying, the smiting &mdash; &rdquo; says Jehu, in a sort of reverie. &ldquo;It was more than just a job, you know?&rdquo;
7:25 AM	&ldquo;There were SEVENTY heads in buckets that day, my friend,&rdquo; says Jehu, &ldquo;and by the way, I'M the one who trampled Jezebel to death...&rdquo;
7:26 AM	&ldquo;...AND I ate a full meal afterwards.&rdquo; Jehu sighs. &ldquo;Wasn't I something else?&rdquo;
7:27 AM	I ask to get the hell off the bus, but Jehu says, &ldquo;Relax, this is Heaven. Nothing bad can ever happen again. It's completely danger free.&rdquo;
7:27 AM	&ldquo;All those virtues,&rdquo; says Jehu, &ldquo; &mdash; courage, fortitude, resilience, restraint, caution, prudence, faith, foresight, moderation, wisdom &mdash; &rdquo;
7:28 AM	&ldquo;Well, you can forget 'em. You don't need 'em here. Isn't that great?&rdquo; says Jehu, yanking the steering wheel violently to one side.
7:30 AM	I move farther back and consider upcoming journey of many &ldquo;Earth&rdquo; days. Why rush? Could take a million years, would still have all eternity.
