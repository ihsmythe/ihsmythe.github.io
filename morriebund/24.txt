Tuesday June 9th
5:34 AM	Guessing that these are my final hours in the Twitterverse and that these will be my final Tweets.
5:37 AM	Everything's ready for my Judy!
7:40 AM	Doorbell rings. I look out window, see Jehu the son of Nimshi pulling away from curb like a madman. And standing at the door is...
7:46 AM	...Jesus! Jesus is at the door! For once I'm happy to see the guy! I fling the door open, and who do I see standing behind Jesus? It's...
7:48 AM	...it's...
7:58 AM	HUBERMAN!!!
7:59 AM	&ldquo;Huberman?!&rdquo; I scream. &ldquo;What's Huberman doing here?&rdquo;
7:59 AM	&ldquo;What do you mean what's Huberman doing here?&rdquo; says Jesus. &ldquo;You said you wanted someone special from your office.
7:59 AM	Obviously, that's Huberman.&rdquo;
8:00 AM	&ldquo;What?! Huberman's not special!&rdquo;
8:00 AM	&ldquo;Oh, come on!&rdquo; says Jesus. &ldquo;Who could be more special than Huberman?&rdquo; Jesus puts his arm around Huberman's shoulders, gives him a squeeze.
8:00 AM	&ldquo;Besides, I have several trillion more years experience than you so I think I know who's special and who isn't.&rdquo;
8:01 AM	&ldquo;But I meant Judy!&rdquo; I cry. &ldquo;Judy's special!&rdquo;
8:01 AM	&ldquo;Judy? I admit Judy's kind of cute,&rdquo; says Jesus, stroking His beard...
8:02 AM	&ldquo;...but just look at Huberman! Look at the cleft in that chin, the dimples, the charm. The executive hair, the snappy dress...&rdquo;
8:02 AM	I grab my thinning hair in bunches, fall to my knees. &ldquo;Imbecile!&rdquo;
8:03 AM	&ldquo;Hey, that's enough of your lip, Buddy!&rdquo; warns Jesus. &ldquo;Let's not forget who sacrificed what for whom...
8:03 AM	...Those weren't little &frac14;-inch finishing nails in my palms you know &mdash; they were hot-dipped galvanized 8-inch cut spikes...
8:03 AM	... And did I mention my crown of thorns? Made from 100% poison ivy. Do you know how itchy I was up there? I had hives in my &mdash; &rdquo;
8:04 AM	&ldquo;Oh, shut up!&rdquo; I sob. &ldquo;Shut up about your spikes and your crown of thorns and your sopping sponge of vinegar! I don't care all right?&rdquo;
8:04 AM	&ldquo;Oh very nice. I get nailed to a cross and this is the thanks I get?&rdquo;
8:05 AM	&ldquo;I meant Judy!&rdquo; I moan. &ldquo;How could you imagine that I meant Huberman?&rdquo;
8:05 AM	&ldquo;Because you're obsessed with Huberman. You always have been, so naturally I just assumed.&rdquo;
8:06 AM	&ldquo;Didn't you read my mind? I thought you said you could read minds!&rdquo;
8:06 AM	&ldquo;Of course I can read minds, but why bother when your species is so predictable?&rdquo;
8:06 AM	&ldquo;Well you clearly didn't know what I was thinking!&rdquo;
8:07 AM	&ldquo;Hey, I heard you thinking in front of my throne, Buddy. YOU thought, and I quote...
8:07 AM	...&lsquo;Huberman. Oh my little Bunnykins!&rsquo; You even texted it. Don't think I didn't see.&rdquo;
8:07 AM	&ldquo;What?!&rdquo;
8:07 AM	&ldquo;Well, look at the transcript. It's all there...
8:08 AM	&lsquo;Note that black side weighed down with thoughts of Judy, Huberman. Oh my little Bunnykins!&rdquo; That's EXACTLY what YOU wrote.&rdquo;
8:08 AM	&ldquo;I meant Judy!&rdquo; I cry. &ldquo;Judy is my Bunnykins!&rdquo;
8:08 AM	Huberman puffing out chest, flexing muscles. &ldquo;You mean my girlfriend Judy? What about her?&rdquo; Huberman seems to be inflating.
8:09 AM	&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; says Huberman, putting two and two together. &ldquo;Is this guy the reason I'm dead?&rdquo;
8:09 AM	&ldquo;Yes, but &mdash; you don't mind do you?&rdquo; says Jesus.
8:09 AM	&ldquo;I thought you'd be happy to see each other. You are his little Bunnykins you know. I figured the feeling was mutual.
8:10 AM	Well, anyway, I'll see you two lovebirds later,&rdquo; says Jesus, turning to leave. Huberman advancing, pounding fist into palm.
8:10 AM	&ldquo;Oy!&rdquo; I shout. &ldquo;I don't want Huberman living with me! You can't leave me alone with him!&rdquo;
8:12 AM	&ldquo;Sorry, Morrie, but we're a bit short on space,&rdquo; explains Jesus. &ldquo;You know, there are a lot more people here than we thought there'd be...
8:12 AM	...so you two are going to bunk up for a while. All right?&rdquo;
8:13 AM	&ldquo;No!&rdquo; I cry, &ldquo;It's not all right! The guy's going to pound the living daylights out of me, can't you see that?&rdquo;
8:13 AM	&ldquo;Well that's nothing to worry about,&rdquo; says Jesus. &ldquo;You know there's no pain in heaven, no death. Only joy.&rdquo;
8:13 AM	&ldquo;And pounding the crap out of you for all eternity's going to give me plenty of joy let me tell you,&rdquo; says Huberman.
8:14 AM	&ldquo;But it won't give ME any joy!&rdquo;
8:14 AM	&ldquo;Sure it will,&rdquo; says Jesus reassuringly. &ldquo;This is heaven. It's all good here.&rdquo;
8:15 AM	&ldquo;Oh please, Jesus! Save me!&rdquo;
8:15 AM	&ldquo;Oh here we go,&rdquo; says Jesus, eyes rolling. &ldquo;Where have I heard THAT before?
8:15 AM	Listen, I saved you already &mdash; remember my sacrifice on the cross? The nails? The spear? The crown of thorns? That was ME saving YOU, got it?&rdquo;
8:16 AM	&ldquo;I mean NOW! Save me from Huberman NOW, you idiot!&rdquo;
8:16 AM	&ldquo;Hey, let's not get stroppy, all right? My ways are higher than your ways, Buddy. A LOT higher, all right? Now you two get settled in &mdash; 
8:16 AM	 &mdash; and later we'll have the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.&rdquo; &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asks Huberman. &ldquo;It's where we marry Him,&rdquo; I say, pointing to Jesus.
8:17 AM	Huberman's eyes as round as dinner plates. &ldquo;Oh don't worry,&rdquo; says Jesus. &ldquo;It's metaphorical. Mostly metaphorical,&rdquo; adds Jesus, winking.
8:17 AM	Cell phone about to die, to just blank out forever and ever. Wish I could join it.
8:17 AM	Here comes Huberman to pound the crap out of me for all eternity.
8:29 AM	It's going to be good.
