Monday May 25th
8:47 AM	Still on bus. Gospel radio station blaring incessantly. Program hosted by <I>The Mourning Show</I> crew of Pope Hilarius, Enoch, and The Coach.
8:48 AM	Enoch prophesies news and weather, other two engage in friendly banter. Also interviews &mdash; St John of the Cross, Habakkuk, Red Buttons...
8:49 AM	Other segments include <I>Ask A Vet</I> with St Francis, <I>D.I.Y.</I> with Noah, and <I>Bible Interpretation</I> with Jesus. (&ldquo;No, no! What I MEANT was...&rdquo;)
8:50 AM	Also various celebrity saints host Thought for the Day. Today's thought by revered church father Origen. His topic...
8:51 AM	...&ldquo;Why cutting off my testicles was the best thing I ever did&rdquo;. Followed by testy debate with Abelard.
8:52 AM	Mary, mother of God, does popular segment on household concerns....
8:53 AM	...&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; says Mary, &ldquo;A lot of people have written into the show asking me how to get blood out of clothing...&rdquo;
8:59 AM	Playing old hymns like &ldquo;What a Friend We Have in Jesus!&rdquo; plus new hymns like &ldquo;Jesus Mowed The Lawn 'Round The Mansion Of My Heart.&rdquo;
10:41 AM	Making attempt to meet fellow passengers. &ldquo;Hi, I'm Morrie,&rdquo; I say to guy in robe and sandals. &ldquo;I'm Elijah,&rdquo; he replies...
10:42 AM	...&ldquo;Elijah the Tishbite. Now you ask, &lsquo;What's a tish bite?&rsquo;&rdquo;
10:44 AM	&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I ask. Elijah responds by elbowing me playfully in the ribs.
10:44 AM	&ldquo;Don't you get it?&rdquo; he replies. &ldquo;What's a tish bite? It's a joke, but if I'm any kind of prophet I'm predicting you're not going to laugh.&rdquo;
10:45 AM	I move to another seat.
2:26 PM	Surrounded by smiling guys in suits with comb-overs. All have Bibles and fierce desire to share the good news of Christ's gruesome death.
2:26 PM	Also a lot of women with big blond hair, knee-length pastel skirts, white blouses, blazers with shoulder pads.
2:27 PM	Looks like the entire cast of The PTL Club, circa 1986, which I know because wife Moira watched faithfully, until Bakker sex scandal...
2:28 PM	...then switched to Jimmy Swaggert show until sex scandal...
2:29 PM	... then Peter Popoff until fraud scandal. Stopped watching just when show getting interesting.
6:06 PM	Manner of death hot topic. Heart attacks and cancer boringly common. Story of bull goring, ambulance crash, tongue-piercing gone septic...
6:06 PM	...frog in throat (actual frog), death on examination table while being probed by alien.
6:07 PM	3 people run over by buses! Real menace those things, as in Billy Connolly Woman on Bus routine. File class action lawsuit from hereafter?
6:20 PM	Time to reflect. Feel like on holiday at garish theme park. Thus strange not sharing with family. Missing wife, son? No. Missing Judy!
6:21 PM	And still loathing Huberman with the white hot intensity of a billion suns.
6:22 PM	And speaking of suns, there isn't one. Not in heaven. No night since illuminated by glory of God 24/7 as in Revelation 21:23...
6:23 PM	...so tough to get a little shut-eye. (Note to self &mdash; buy window coverings.)
6:33 PM	Just realized no need to sleep or eat. So deal is you can satisfy any bodily urge in heaven, but you don't have any bodily urges to satisfy.
6:33 PM	Must consider full, terrifying implications.
