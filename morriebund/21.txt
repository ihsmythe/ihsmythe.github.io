Saturday June 6th
8:44 AM	The doorbell rings. Mormons? JWs? Jesus, god forbid? No. It's Mary Kay doing her rounds with Tammy Faye Bakker and Frank Zappa on a chain.
8:44 AM	I slam the door immediately, continue watching Highway to Heaven marathon.
8:50 AM	The bell rings again. Oh no. It IS Him this time. &ldquo;Hello, Lord.&rdquo;
8:51 AM	&ldquo;Hello, Morrie,&rdquo; says Jesus with a big sigh. &ldquo;So...
8:51 AM	...again you've been shirking. You haven't praised me in days and I'm feeling a bit neglected I don't mind telling you.&rdquo;
8:51 AM	&ldquo;Yeah, I know,&rdquo; I reply, scuffing my shoe. &ldquo;It's just &mdash; well, it's like I said to Peter. No offence but it's not very interesting here.&rdquo;
8:52 AM	&ldquo;Hey listen, Buddy, you're lucky to be here. It's only by the grace of ME that you're here at all. MY grace, MY sacrifice. Got that?&rdquo;
8:52 AM	&ldquo;Yeah, I know but &mdash; &rdquo;
8:52 AM	&ldquo;Hey! Just don't forget about MY surrender on the cross, all right? YOU try sucking a sponge of vinegar, see if YOU like it.
8:52 AM	That spear in my side? YOUR fault, not mine. I took the hit, right? I was blameless but because of YOUR sin, Mr Sinful, I got martyred.&rdquo;
8:54 AM	&ldquo;You sound like my mother.&rdquo;
8:55 AM	Jesus glared.
8:55 AM	&ldquo;It's just &mdash; I think I'm lonely,&rdquo; I say.
8:56 AM	&ldquo;Lonely?&rdquo; exclaims Christ. &ldquo;Christ! How can you be lonely with Mother Theresa living across the street? The woman's a maniac! I mean...
8:56 AM	...she parties nonstop. Her place is always packed. The throbbing music, the strobe lights, the booze &mdash; it's like a discotheque over there.&rdquo;
8:57 AM	&ldquo;That's disco-Tek, Lord &mdash; hard &lsquo;t&rsquo; sound.&rdquo;
8:57 AM	&ldquo;Whatever,&rdquo; says Christ.
8:58 AM	&ldquo;It's just, I was hoping for &mdash;  &rdquo; I pause meaningfully  &mdash;  &ldquo;that special someone.&rdquo;
8:58 AM	&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; says Jesus. &ldquo;Right. Now I get it.&rdquo;
8:58 AM	&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; I ask, hopefully.
8:59 AM	&ldquo;Of course I do. Do you think I'm not a mind reader? I AM God, you know, no matter what the Jews say. And the Hindus. And Richard Dawkins.
8:59 AM	Anyway, you've done nothing but obsess about it since you got here and it's really starting to get on my nerves.&rdquo;
8:59 AM	&ldquo;Sorry, Jesus,&rdquo; I say, then ask, &ldquo;so &mdash; is there anything you can do about it?&rdquo;
9:00 AM	&ldquo;Yeah, fine, whatever. I'll arrange it. An untimely death and then &mdash; whoosh &mdash; your sweetheart &mdash; your &lsquo;little Bunnykins&rsquo; &mdash; will be in your arms.&rdquo;
9:00 AM	&ldquo;What?! Really?!&rdquo; This is incredible. I can't believe my ears. &ldquo;And what about living arrangements? I mean, could I get a room ready?...
9:00 AM	...Even a...a...bed? Could we, uh, share?&rdquo;
9:01 AM	&ldquo;Frankly I don't care what you do as long as you stop moping. Obsessing. You've been a wet blanket ever since you got here.&rdquo;
9:01 AM	&ldquo;Oh, Jesus!&rdquo; I cry, &ldquo;All that's all going to change. We'll explore heaven, go to TNJ, church picnics &mdash; &rdquo;
9:01 AM	&ldquo;Fine, fine, whatever. I don't care. Just so long as you start praising me again.&rdquo;
9:02 AM	&ldquo;But, as I've mentioned, Jesus, I find worship extremely bor &mdash; &rdquo;
9:02 AM	&ldquo;Hey! Do you want that special someone or not?&rdquo;
9:02 AM	&ldquo;Sorry Lord! Oh, and by the way, you know I don't mean my wife, right? I mean from the office &mdash; &rdquo;
9:03 AM	&ldquo;I know exactly who you mean, you devil. I know whose hair you want to stroke, whose lips you want to kiss...
9:03 AM	...I'm like a prophet that way. And I wasn't exactly born yesterday, you know. I can read the signs.&rdquo;
9:03 AM	&ldquo;Well &mdash; hallelujah!&rdquo; I cry, meaning it for once. &ldquo;I praise you, oh Jesus, thank you, oh Jesus!&rdquo;
9:03 AM	&ldquo;Oh that's much better!&rdquo; says Jesus encouragingly. &ldquo;Hey, I've got an idea...
9:04 AM	... why don't you do that thing where you raise your hands and get filled with my spirit? Maybe do a bit of that babbling I like so much.&rdquo;
9:04 AM	&ldquo;You mean speaking in tongues?&rdquo;
9:04 AM	&ldquo;Yeah, that's it. I love that, it's so totally crazy. I never came up with that, you know, it was all your guys' idea.&rdquo;
9:04 AM	&ldquo;Well, I've never done it, but...&rdquo; I fall to my knees and raise my hands. &ldquo;Bo so foe joe no crow blow ko so roe.&rdquo;
9:05 AM	&ldquo;STOP!&rdquo; cries Jesus. &ldquo;Get outta here! That's Judoon! Who do you think I am, Dr Who? Now I know you're faking. Let's try again.&rdquo;
9:05 AM	Sigh. &ldquo;Oh freddled gruntbuggly &mdash; &rdquo;
9:05 AM	&ldquo;ADAMS!&rdquo;
9:05 AM	One last time. &ldquo;Oh &mdash; Sniffleheimen Obblanox! Purdingly snik buntsnoo....
9:06 AM	&ldquo;Oh yeah, that feels great,&rdquo; says the Lord, looking stoned. &ldquo;Keep it up, Sport, keep it up.&rdquo;
