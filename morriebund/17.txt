Tuesday June 2nd
9:08 AM	I hear someone outside front door. &ldquo;Behold I stand at the door and knock,&rdquo; He says, which is what passes for humour around here.
9:08 AM	I open the door. It's the Lord Jesus. Surprise, surprise
9:09 AM	&ldquo;So &mdash; &ldquo; (Jesus examines fingernails) &mdash;  &ldquo;you haven't been to the throne to worship me lately. Do you want to tell me why not?&rdquo;
9:09 AM	Awkward pause. &ldquo;Well, I can only say thank you so many times. After the first couple of hundred times I don't get much out of it, really.&rdquo;
9:10 AM	&ldquo;Oh, I get it,&rdquo; replies Jesus. &ldquo;It's all about YOU.&rdquo;
9:10 AM	&ldquo;Well &mdash; you got my Thank You card, didn't you?&rdquo; I ask.
9:10 AM	&ldquo;I didn't like it&rdquo; He says.
9:11 AM	&ldquo;Well, Jesus, I'm a bank manager, not a poet. If you needed investment advice or a second mortgage it would be different but....&rdquo;
9:11 AM	&ldquo;Well &mdash; anyway I liked the stickers.&rdquo; Pause. &ldquo;Especially the ones of my head. You don't forget what a crown of thorns feels like, my friend.&rdquo;
9:11 AM	&ldquo;No, I guess you wouldn't. Although it has been a couple of thousand years now.&rdquo;
9:12 AM	&ldquo;Well, yeah. But that's not really the point, is it.&rdquo;
9:12 AM	&ldquo;What is the point, Lord?&rdquo;
9:13 AM	&ldquo;The point is, I deserve to be worshipped,&rdquo; says Jesus. &rdquo;I mean, HELLO! I died for your sins, in case you'd forgotten.&rdquo;
9:13 AM	&ldquo;Well, not specifically for MY sins,&rdquo; I point out. &ldquo;I mean, if I'd never been born, you still would have gotten nailed to that cross.&rdquo;
9:14 AM	&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo; says Jesus, flinching. &ldquo;You just said that so casually. Getting nailed to that tree was no Sunday School picnic you know...
9:14 AM	...Anyway, it IS true I died to save the whole world, which only makes my sacrifice that much more magnificent.&rdquo;
9:15 AM	&ldquo;Well, Jesus, a lot of people give their lives for other people,&rdquo; I point out. &ldquo;It's not really that unique a feat...
9:15 AM	...especially if you think your death will save the whole world. Who wouldn't give their lives under those conditions?...
9:15 AM	...I mean, You died to save billions of people,&rdquo; I continue, &ldquo;which on a per capita basis, really isn't that impressive.&rdquo;
9:16 AM	Jesus sulked.
9:17 AM	&ldquo;I suppose it's true my blood's spread a little thin.&rdquo; Jesus looks wounded &mdash; I feel like a heel. &ldquo;Sorry, Jesus.&rdquo;
9:17 AM	&ldquo;No, really, it's okay,&rdquo; says Jesus, looking hurt. &ldquo;I'm not hurt, all right? I just need a little more gratitude.&rdquo;
9:18 AM	&ldquo;It's just that if a human being wants to be worshipped,&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;we generally put him in a straightjacket and lock him up, you know?&rdquo;
9:18 AM	&ldquo;I realize that. And it's true I'm all man,&rdquo; says Jesus, flexing His biceps.
9:19 AM	&ldquo;But I'm also all God, and gods get worshipped. That's how you interact socially with a god. It's completely normal in divine circles.&rdquo;
9:21 AM	&ldquo;But why do you need to be worshipped?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Why can't you just be happy without relying on other people to make you feel special?&rdquo;
9:21 AM	&ldquo;Because I'm a god, and all gods thrive on praise. We're like kids that way. We like to be encouraged and told when we're doing well...
9:23 AM	...It's pretty much universal, haven't you noticed?&rdquo; He adds. &ldquo;We like to see our creatures on their knees, whispering sweet nothings.&rdquo;
9:24 AM	&ldquo;It just seems so &mdash; medieval, you know?&rdquo; I point out. &ldquo;Haven't we moved on from there?&rdquo;
9:24 AM	&ldquo;I haven't,&rdquo; Jesus replies. &ldquo;I'm timeless and eternal. It worked in 3 B.C. and it still works today...
9:25 AM	...I just like praise, okay? It feels right, you know? So why don't you bow down before me right now, and say a few &lsquo;Thank you Jesus's.&rsquo;&rdquo;
9:25 AM	&ldquo;How long do I have to keep thanking you for that one sacrifice?&rdquo;
9:25 AM	&ldquo;Well &mdash; forever, really.&rdquo;
9:26 AM	&ldquo;You're going to keep bringing it up for all eternity? I have to be grateful forever?&rdquo;
9:26 AM	&ldquo;Well, come on &mdash; those nails really hurt you know.&rdquo;
9:26 AM	I kneel down. &ldquo;Thank you Jesus. Thank you, thank you.&rdquo;
9:27 AM	&ldquo;Yeah, that's right,&rdquo; says Jesus with a dreamy look on His face. &ldquo;Keep going......&rdquo;
