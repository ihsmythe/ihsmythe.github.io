Wednesday June 3rd
9:59 AM	<I>&ldquo;And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.&rdquo;</I> Revelation 9:6.
10:00 AM	Don't know what to do with self. Spent morning hanging, stabbing, disembowelling self, just in case. No pain, no death, no luck.
11:48 AM	All alone in eternal house, wearing crown, surveying fabulous riches, priceless relics, gothic splendour.
11:48 AM	Oh my Judy! How she would love moonstone microwave, tourmaline toaster, spodumene sponge bag!!!
11:50 AM	Not sure she would love relics as much. True that Joseph's coat of many colours makes an attractive bedspread with matching dust-ruffle...
11:51 AM	...and Entertainment Centre classy antique, as made of wood reclaimed from holy cradle...
11:52 AM	...(though stereo refuses to play anything but John Tesh's &ldquo;Sax All Night&rdquo; and &ldquo;Grand Piano Christmas&rdquo;. Help!) However...
11:52 AM	...some relics a bit spooky. Do not care for tibia-bone comb, lampshades made from martyr's scalps, placemats woven from St Ruan The Hairy.
11:53 AM	Nor do I care for toothpicks made from &mdash; guess what? &mdash; nor for spatula/scapula made from St Lawrence (patron St of cooks).
11:55 AM	Sticker on bathroom scale claims it's made from scales that fell from Paul's eyes on road to Damascus. Oh please.
1:47 PM	Currently preparing comfort food. Naturally marshmallows in cocoa arrange themselves into shape of cross.
1:47 PM	Made toast in tourmaline toaster. Had face of Mary, wept butter.
8:55 PM	Half-heartedly watching TV. Disney on Ice, The Flying Nun, Britain's Got Talent with Simon's face blotted out.
8:55 PM	Bored, bored, bored, and only a couple of weeks into eternity.
