Friday May 22nd
8:15 AM	Moving ever closer to pearly gates. Seems intuitively obvious that giant pearl would make worst gate possible. Just try attaching hinges!
10:34 AM	Finally at gates of heaven! As suspected, giant pearls impractical. On a winch. St Peter hunched over desk, checking Book of Life for name.
10:36 AM	For Pete's sake! Could the man flip pages any more slowly? Must he lick index finger every time?
10:56 AM	Ages later my name found in Book of Life, thank God! But...oh, drat! Name spelled wrong. Ho hum, more processing of papers, more red tape.
10:56 AM	St Peter looking haggard, bored, like maybe could deny Christ fourth time.
10:58 AM	Feeling sorry for St Peter. Fisherman turned administrator. Desk cluttered with forms, comically oversized keys, bait.
12:12 PM	Error in Book of Life corrected. Able to enter heaven freely? No, more paperwork which, being a former manager, I rather enjoy.
12:13 PM	Given citizenship and immigration application. To be given refugee status &mdash; as in Psalm 46:1 &ldquo;God is my refuge.&rdquo; Therefore, by extension...
12:16 PM	Must fill in date of birth, smoking/nonsmoking, religious affiliation (only one box to check off ), sex (again, one box &mdash; <input type="radio" name="sex" checked>NO)...
12:17 PM	...SIN number. NOT Social Insurance Number &mdash; actual sin, i.e., quantity of sin in before-life...
12:17 PM	...height of new spiritual body (same as former carnal body), weight (zero).
2:50 PM	All forms finally filled out. Given Bible, map, pamphlet (&ldquo;It's YOUR Heaven!!!&rdquo;) in handy carrying case.
2:51 PM	Attempting to ditch Mother, but hanging on to sleeve, cannot be shaken or peeled off.
2:53 PM	More waiting. Angels suggest activities to relieve boredom, all of which involve worshipping Jesus &mdash; does not sound promising but will try...
3:00 PM	I worship thee, Oh Jesus, I praise thee, Oh Jesus, Gentle Jesus meek and mild, Our Father who art here, actually, and so forth and so on...
3:01 PM	Worship of Jesus not proving to be boredom buster so studying map of heaven instead.
3:02 PM	River of Waters of Life (H<sub>2</sub>O?), Tree of Life that beareth 12 types of fruit (due to miracle of grafting, presumably), mansions with names &mdash;
3:02 PM	&mdash; including mine! A bit on the smallish side but can't be picky. Gosh! Will be living across street from Mother Theresa!
3:03 PM	Will also be living across the street from Mother. Jesus Christ. &ldquo;What? No, no I wasn't talking to you...&rdquo;
