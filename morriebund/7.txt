Saturday May 23rd
7:04 AM	Being guided through pearly gates by huffy, sour-faced Angel (perhaps did not expect to be glorified doorman when created)...
7:05 AM	...past signs with silhouettes of ne'er-do-wells with red slashes through them. No whoremongers, sorcerers, idolators, as in Rev.21:8.
7:07 AM	Finally in heaven! Wow! Very impressive, sparkling clean, if a bit sticky due to land flowing with milk and honey.
7:10 AM	Standing at bustling intersection of streets of gold. Streets lined with crosses instead of lampposts, Jesus-fish on manhole covers...
7:10 AM	...traffic lights of emerald, ruby, amber. Opals embedded in road as lane dividers. Not in Kansas anymore, Toto.
7:11 AM	Double decker buses of garnet, wheels of onyx, pearl headlights. Exhaust smells pine fresh, buses silent. Hard not to get run over again.
7:13 AM	Permanent rainbow overhead. Lots of billboards &mdash; slogans like &ldquo;God is Love&rdquo; and &ldquo;We Told You So&rdquo;.
7:25 AM	Massive golden buildings studded with diamonds, rubies, emeralds, pearls, endangered-animal parts. Classy.
7:29 AM	A lot of neon, colourful fountains, palm trees. Like Vegas, without the casinos. Instead churches galore. A religious person's paradise.
7:34 AM	Signs on church lawns say things like, &ldquo;Worship Service &mdash; Ongoing, Eternal&rdquo; and &ldquo;Are YOU saved? Don't be an idiot! You're here, aren't you?&rdquo;
8:24 AM	Many citizens wearing robes, shoes, ball caps with IHS printed on them. Maybe brand name. Short for what? I hate sin? I heart salvation?
8:25 AM	Also lots of people with VFD on their robes and a tattoo of an eye on one ankle. Not a clue.
8:38 AM	Angels a bit of a nuisance, flying around all over the place. Loud! All those flapping wings, all that infernal singing. Preening, roosting.
8:40 AM	Chart by side of road &mdash; angels in silhouette, labelled. Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominions, Virtues, Powers, Principalities, Archangels.
8:40 AM	Can tell apart by structure. Eg. Angel dive-bombing me (too close to nest?) &mdash; Seraphim. Obvious by shape of spoiler, horizontal stabilizers.
11:14 AM	Finally managed to ditch Mother by darting into Heman's Harp Shop.
11:14 AM	&ldquo;Hi, you look new,&rdquo; says guy in sackcloth, ashes. &ldquo;I'm Heman &mdash; maybe you know me from Psalm 88?&rdquo;
11:15 AM	&ldquo;Afraid not,&rdquo; I reply. &ldquo;Oh, come on, I wrote it,&rdquo; Heman says. &ldquo;Listen to this...&rdquo;
11:15 AM	&ldquo;<I>&lsquo;I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up; while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.&rsquo;</I> Ring any bells?&rdquo;
11:16 AM	&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; I say. Heman sighs. &ldquo;They never remember the little guys of the Bible do they? It's all Jesus this and Jesus that...&rdquo;
11:17 AM	&ldquo;...What about Chuza?&rdquo; asks Heman. &ldquo;Hmm? Ever heard of Chuza?&rdquo;
11:17 AM	&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; I say, backing away. &ldquo;What about Jeduthun? Abihu? Bezalel?&rdquo; &ldquo;Nope,&rdquo; I reply, tripping on a sign that says &ldquo;Psale on psalteries!&rdquo;
11:18 AM	&ldquo;It's always the way,&rdquo; says Heman. &ldquo;Gad, Huldah, Jochebed, Me &mdash; we're all forgotten. It's just like I said in my Psalm &mdash; Psalm 88 &mdash;&rdquo;
11:18 AM	&ldquo;<I>&lsquo;Like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more, thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps &mdash; &rsquo;</I> &rdquo;
11:19 AM	I interrupt. &ldquo;There's no such word.&rdquo; &ldquo;What?&rdquo; says Heman, clearly annoyed. &ldquo;There's no such word as &lsquo;deeps&rsquo;.&rdquo;
11:19 AM	&ldquo;Hey buddy,&rdquo; replies Heman, &ldquo;do you know what &lsquo;infallible&rsquo; means?&rdquo;
11:28 AM	After boring argument, and being offered lessons on the cymbals (&ldquo;They're my specialty &mdash; hey, it's not as easy as it looks you know&rdquo;)...
11:28 AM	...I escape Heman's clutches. Study map &mdash; note that mansion across town. Thousands of furlongs across town.
11:32 AM	Find bus stop, sit on pew. Will wait for God knows how long. Note carillon playing old hymn: &ldquo;Fade, Fade, Each Earthly Joy&rdquo;. Oh my Judy!
