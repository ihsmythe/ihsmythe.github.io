Thursday May 21st
7:37 AM	Still outside pearly gates, still incredulous. Must be joke, nightmare. Asked Mother to pinch self, felt no pain. Left hook to jaw &mdash; nothing.
7:37 AM	WANTED poster plastered on exterior walls of heaven. Note that Richard Dawkins in deep doo-doo.
7:38 AM	Likewise Hitchens, Harris, Hirsi Ali, Fry, Laurie, Penn, Teller, Davies, Allen, Attenborough, Blackmore, Branson, DiFranco, Simpson (Lisa)..
7:39 AM	...Steinem, Sweeney, Thompson,   Briain, Chomsky, Dennett, Pinker, Pullman, Foster, Shatner, Bj&ouml;rk, Lehrer, Rushdie, Randi, Pratchett....
7:40 AM	Phil Collins apparently in big trouble for song &ldquo;Jesus He Knows Me.&rdquo;
7:41 AM	Also Sussudio &mdash; unforgivable. (If unforgivable, is composing Sussudio the sin against the Holy Ghost as in Mark 3:29?)
7:42 AM	Poster on wall 6,000 furlongs square. Heavenly hostess explains heaven a city as in many cartoons/Revelation/Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey.
7:45 AM	City walls composed of 12 layers precious stone. Each layer well over 100 miles high (on Earth only 50 miles to space) so layer-effect lost.
7:45 AM	Calculate that walls of heaven about 780,000 stories high. Just a bit boxy! Name of architect? Avoid!
7:47 AM	Can't stop thinking about Judy, more precious than precious stone. Was so looking forward to stroking hair, kissing lips, introducing self.
8:25 PM	Conversing with various people/angels/burning bushes/talking donkeys as in Numbers 22:30. Seem to be a lot of Christians around here.
