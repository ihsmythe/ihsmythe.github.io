Friday June 5th
9:28 AM	Decide to get out of mansion, have a jog, explore. Avoid using front door as Mother always peering out of open attic window, like sniper.
9:39 AM	I run into St Peter and ask about transfer to Mormon heaven. Peter rolls eyes.
9:40 AM	&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;if I sent every guy who asked me for a transfer to Mormon heaven, there wouldn't be any men left in THIS heaven, okay?&rdquo;
9:40 AM	I sigh. &ldquo;The thing is, Peter, there's just not very much to do here, in this heaven. It's not very, you know...interesting.&rdquo;
9:41 AM	&ldquo;Hey, it's EXACTLY like it's described in the Book of Revelation,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;The streets of gold, the mansions, the New Jerusalem...
9:41 AM	...it's all in the Bible, Buddy. Read it and weep.
9:43 AM	Besides, heaven is all about worshipping God,&rdquo; says Peter defensively. &ldquo;THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. The Bible is really very clear about it...
9:44 AM	...so it's not exactly as if you were tricked into this afterlife, is it?
9:44 AM	Honestly!&rdquo; Peter continues testily, &ldquo;if you didn't like the sound of it, why did you ask JESUS to save you?&rdquo;
9:46 AM	&ldquo;I wasn't thinking,&rdquo; I reply. &ldquo;Ah, now we're getting the truth of the matter,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;You weren't thinking...
9:46 AM	...because if you HAD been thinking you would have asked Allah to save you. That way you could've been in heaven with 72 virgins right now.&rdquo;
9:47 AM	&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; I reply, completely awed by the idea and aching with regret.
9:48 AM	&ldquo;Nah,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;That's just what they tell people. It's marketing....
9:49 AM	Besides, what do you think the women are supposed to do? What kind of heaven would that be for them? You think they get 72 pool boys?&rdquo;
9:51 AM	&ldquo;What exactly do the women get?&rdquo; I ask.
9:51 AM	&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replies St Peter, &ldquo;it's sort of like Ikea....
9:51 AM	Anyway, why don't you get out more, make friends. Get to know Mother Theresa, for example &mdash; she lives right across the street from you.&rdquo;
9:52 AM	&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;We can talk about holiness, and leprosy. Thanks for the tip.&rdquo;
9:52 AM	&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;MT's changed &mdash; she swears, smokes, spits...
9:52 AM	...and spends all day in a bikini in her hot tub getting rubdowns from buff angelic types.&rdquo;
9:53 AM	&ldquo;What?! That's disgusting!&rdquo; I exclaim. &ldquo;Mother Theresa is supposed to be a paragon of holiness and virtue!&rdquo;
9:53 AM	&ldquo;Well, come on, give her a break,&rdquo; replies Peter. &ldquo;She didn't have much of a life did she? Listen, that's what heaven's all about &mdash; 
9:53 AM	1) worshipping God and 2) being given an eternity of goodies to make up for all the innocent suffering you went through on Earth.&rdquo;
9:56 AM	&ldquo;But you can't make up for innocent suffering!&rdquo; I counter, on behalf of all tortured kittens everywhere.
9:56 AM	&ldquo;Well what are we supposed to do?&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;What's your bright idea? &ldquo;Listen &mdash; think of the kingdom of heaven as a government, right?
9:56 AM	...and think of God as the president. All knowing, all powerful and, frankly, a bit of a screw-up....
9:57 AM	So you can't really say that innocent suffering isn't ultimately his fault, can you. Now...
9:57 AM	...when a government screws up, what do they do? How do they usually compensate people for innocent suffering?&rdquo;
9:57 AM	&ldquo;They give them money?&rdquo;
9:57 AM	&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo; replies Peter. &ldquo;Compensating victims with material wealth is standard procedure. It's our way of saying...
9:58 AM	...sorry about your miserable life and traumatic death...
9:58 AM	...we'll make it up to you with a solid magnetite computer and a 100 % martyr-bone dinette set, okay?
9:59 AM	You see the beauty of the system? You throw people a bone (sometimes literally), everybody's happy, and nobody's suing anybody.&rdquo;
9:59 AM	&ldquo;Well what about all those people who go to hell?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;What about their suffering?&rdquo;
9:59 AM	&ldquo;Their suffering is, clearly, THEIR fault,&rdquo; says Peter in a huffy tone. &ldquo;They were warned and yet they still chose NOT to believe in God.&rdquo;
10:00 AM	&ldquo;Oh come on,&rdquo; I protest. &ldquo;Is not believing in God really such a big deal?&rdquo;
10:00 AM	&ldquo;Hey, Buddy,&rdquo; says Peter, wagging his finger in a warning sort of way, &ldquo;how would you like it if somebody didn't believe in you?&rdquo;
10:00 AM	&ldquo;But I'm not invisible! If I was invisible, I think I'd understand it!&rdquo;
10:01 AM	Conversation pointless, like talking to wall. More than one reason why Peter has reputation as a rock.
10:01 AM	No hope of transfer to more desirable heaven. No hope of anything.
10:01 AM	Walking home, head bowed. Damn, forgot to ask about Marriage Supper of the Lamb.
10:02 AM	Will do it tomorrow...
10:02 AM	...except &mdash; no tomorrow. Eternity one endless, sunny day.
10:03 AM	Suddenly remember old life: watching sports on TV, sitting in recliner with cold beer, nuts. Said it was heaven on earth...
10:03 AM	That's what's needed here &mdash; more earth in heaven.
