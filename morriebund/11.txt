Wednesday May 27th
9:19 AM	Still on bus. Tiring of fellow passengers. Self-congratulatory, smug &mdash; like punter who, by sheer luck, picks (or was born into) winning team.
9:58 AM	Perusing pamphlets in order to distract self from thoughts of nemesis &mdash; the person who has, essentially, stolen my life. (HUBERMAN!)
10:01 AM	Reading description of MY mansion &mdash; my eternal home in fundamentalist Christian heaven.
10:02 AM	(&ldquo;Home&rdquo; as in mental asylum? Evidence highly suggestive.)
10:03 AM	<I>Picture-perfect two story, mother-of-pearl siding. Convenient to throne of God, river of life, shopping. Quiet neighbourhood.</I>
10:03 AM	<I>Huge 50 x 120 foot lot, fenced, mature trees and bushes (fig, olive, juniper, myrtle), perennials (lilies of field, burning bush).</I>
10:03 AM	<I>A unicorn owner's dream!</I>
10:05 AM	<I>Dramatic two-story vestibule, gothic arches, cathedral ceilings. Easy access to public transit. Urban executive charm. Fully furnished.</I>
10:05 AM	<I>(Want to change your furnishings? We pick up and deliver in the manner approved of by God Himself. Call Mysterious Ways Moving today!)</I>
10:07 AM	<I>Elegant master bedroom with 3-piece ensuite. Golden soaker tub, stained glass shower stall, platinum toilet, bidet cut from single diamond.</I>
10:08 AM	<I>All new appliances as in Revelation 21:5 &mdash; &ldquo;Behold I make all things new.&rdquo;</I>
10:09 AM	<I>Impeccably maintained, immaculately conceived. Spotless, washed in blood of Jesus.</I>
10:10 AM	<I>Jade den + amethyst bonus room above garage. Gleaming solid gold floors throughout.</I>
10:10 AM	<I>Oversized windows allow glory of God to illuminate eat-in kitchen.</I>
10:11 AM	<I>Malachite fireplace in great room. Onyx deck with sapphire pool, quartz hot tub, solid brass barbeque. Can upgrade. Endless possibilities.</I>
2:02 PM	Ha! Guessing Huberman doesn't have alabaster doorknobs, gold-leafed eavestroughs, and a solid magnetite computer with infinite RAM!
2:04 PM	Small consolation. Want Judy, not topaz toaster oven. Damn Huberman to hell!
2:06 PM	Say, I wonder if Huberman IS going to hell!? Happy thought! Must ask St Peter to check for Huberman's name in Book of Life ASAP!
