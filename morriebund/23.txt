Monday June 8th
8:21 AM	Still feeling nauseous over totally creepy Marriage Supper of the Lamb business. NOT GAY so, naturally, do NOT want to be bride of Jesus.
8:22 AM	Am used to idea of thanking Him FOREVER for that ONE sacrifice and, though obviously vile, eating His body and drinking His blood...
8:23 AM	...but marrying the guy? Oh come on! Even metaphorically, idea appalling, sleazy.
8:23 AM	Would be far more comfortable with ceremony making Jesus, say, vice president or head coach &mdash; NOT husband. Don't want to be the woman!
6:06 PM	Ah! Jesus just phoned about MY SPECIAL SOMEONE! Judy's in heaven already and He's bringing her around tomorrow!
6:07 PM	Must spend rest of day polishing gems, appliances, relics, worshipping the Lord (MUST stay on good side!!!)
6:14 PM	Yesterday had phoned Ex Nihilo Furniture and Supply Company, ordered luxuries for my Judy.
6:15 PM	Ex Nihilo just came around with tiny minivan, pulled out gigantic mirror for ceiling plus king-sized holy-water bed.
6:25 PM	Hope Judy will love creamy satin Shroud of Turin duvet and pillow shams.
6:40 PM	Just realized that tomorrow cell phone will probably be cut off for eternity, if Moira did not pay bill.
6:41 PM	Will likely not be able to Twitter, but will certainly be IN a twitter!
6:42 PM	Really, no time to tweet. Must make everything perfect for my little Bunnykins (as Jesus ALWAYS refers to her &mdash; so sweet!)
