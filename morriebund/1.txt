Sunday May 17th
2:33 PM	Tweet! Have opened Twitter account so can broadcast activities, opinions, state of health to entire planet.
2:51 PM	Boldly making public what was once considered private and tiresome.
2:52 PM	Sunday, church &mdash; forced to attend by wife. Asinine sermon, ought to have food critic review communion. Ack! Must Jesus taste like cardboard?
2:54 PM	Sermon based on Judges 14-16 story of Samson and Delilah. Estimate IQ of Samson maybe 68 tops. Completely incapable of pattern recognition.
2:55 PM	Typical Biblical character. None too bright but willing to do his part for mythology.
2:55 PM	But Noah! What a guy! Boss gives impossible assignment, he accepts. Exactly how I've risen up the ranks myself. Expect promotion tomorrow.
2:58 PM	Yes, promotion. And about time &mdash; best years of life etc. Deserve raise, corner office, Judy. Too bad bowels stopped up with Moira's tongue...
2:58 PM	...sandwich. Preparing by shellacking shoes, shining suit, collecting two of every animal, metaphorically speaking. Ready for glory!
2:59 PM	Still, nervous, uncertain. Have been overlooked for promotion before in favour of Huberman. Huberman the &Uuml;berman. CEO's pet.
2:59 PM	Damn Huberman! Damn his manicured nails, his executive hair, his irresistible charm!
3:01 PM	I see Judy looking at him &mdash; like a little girl gazing at a firefighter who's just rescued a kitten. Let me rescue your kitten Judy!
3:02 PM	Meanwhile, will watch playoffs. Money riding on outcome. Recliner, cold beer, nuts. Heaven on Earth.
4:11 PM	Good God! Have these guys ever played this sport before? Definitely not digging deep, not giving 110%. Reminded of Samson post-haircut.
4:24 PM	Down $50. Post-game interview, player says, &ldquo;We just weren't motivated.&rdquo; What? The man makes 3 million dollars a year, what does it take?
4:43 PM	Moira calling for supper. Must feign sleep.
4:54 PM	Reminder to self: let Trevor out of basement.
