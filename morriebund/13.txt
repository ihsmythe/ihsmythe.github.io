Friday May 29th
9:28 AM	Time for Welcome Party. In park beside river of life that proceedeth out of throne of God. Will bring Wonder Bread and fish. BYOB (Bible).
9:39 AM	Walking by many mansions &mdash; even jewel-encrusted doghouse (Lassie). Cell phone keeps working without need to be recharged. Must be in heaven.
9:40 AM	Also eternal and unlimited browse and text.
9:41 AM	But &mdash; (!!!) if Moira doesn't pay bill, cell phone will be cut off in only about 10 Earth days. Will make most of it while still operational.
9:54 AM	Found golden postbox, sent Thank You card to Jesus. Decorated with Christian imagery: stickers of lambs, rainbows, eggs, gory Jesus heads.
9:55 AM	Three huge thrones in distance with river gushing out. Also noisy crowd and banners reading &ldquo;Welcome to the Kingdom!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Go Believers!&rdquo;
11:00 AM	Greeted at gates of Welcome to Heaven party by Abraham, Sarah, Noah, Maude Flanders.
11:01 AM	Maude Flanders fictional, yes, but undoubtedly just as alive as Abraham, Sarah, Noah ever were.
11:59 AM	Wow. Huge spread &mdash; lots of biblical foods &mdash; manna, figs, goat, spelt, potato salad, body and blood of Christ. (Shake and Bake?)
11:59 AM	Also ice cream cake approximately one city block square &mdash; special message written in pink icing &mdash; &ldquo;Well done thou good and faithful servant.&rdquo;
12:00 PM	Karen Carpenter, Princess Di, Catherine of Sienna &mdash; all gathered around table &mdash; binging and purging to their heart's content.
12:47 PM	Musicians entertaining. Elvis, Palestrina, psalmist David (now goes by &ldquo;Dave&rdquo;), The Pope Gregory Plainchant Project, 101 Strings...
12:47 PM	Ask if they take requests, am told yes, then ask them to play &ldquo;Imagine&rdquo;. Much shuffling, furtive glances. Claim they've never heard of it.
12:55 PM	First glimpse of God. Like sun with beard, scowl. Eyes shifty, looking jealous, paranoid. Security checking for golden idols/graven images.
12:56 PM	Apparently God moody S.O.B. as in O.T. Not happy with fornicators, feminists, gays, menstruating women, stem-cell researchers. Could smite.
12:56 PM	Jesus Christ at right hand of God? No! Good Lord! It's Jerry Falwell looking smug and overfed, as always.
12:57 PM	Throne at left hand reserved for Oral Roberts/Billy Graham/Jimmy Swaggert/Jim Bakker/Pat Robertson. (Will have to sit on laps, snuggle).
12:58 PM	Surprised to see four huge beasts with six wings each covered with eyes front and back as in Stephen King horror novel...
12:59 PM	... each worshipping God as in Revelation chapter 4. No trainers, no cages. Holy, holy, holy s---.
1:00 PM	Backing away slowly from freakish, Yahweh-worshipping, multi-eyed beasts. One like lion, one like eagle, one like calf, one like Mother.
1:22 PM	Bizarre and unexpected mish-mash of people here from prehistoric times to present. When did God start saving people from eternal damnation?
1:22 PM	Did not expect Cro-magnons, Neanderthals, Flintstones.
1:22 PM	Wish Lucy the Australopithecine would shave, put on clothes, as too strongly reminded of Moira's mother.
1:35 PM	Others include many O.T. figures &mdash; not technically Christian but Jesus only gleam in God's eye in BC times, so unbelief not their fault.
1:36 PM	Introduced to Adam, Eve, their sons, and all of their sisters whom they had to marry. A lot of grandchildren with 6 toes, third eye, etc.
1:37 PM	Introduced to Samson and Delilah. Samson shaved bald, wearing sunglasses. Delilah wearing &lsquo;I'm with stupid&rsquo; t-shirt.
1:52 PM	Also introduced to Gomer and Hosea. &ldquo;Oh, YOU'RE Gomer!&rdquo; I say to her. &ldquo;I heard you over the phone &mdash; you were the one who said &lsquo;Come Peter&rsquo;.&rdquo;
1:52 PM	When I say &ldquo;Come Peter&rdquo; Gomer coughs loudly. &ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; asks Hosea.
1:52 PM	&ldquo;Nothing darling,&rdquo; says Gomer. &ldquo;He said that I was the one who said &lsquo;com-puter.&rsquo;&rdquo; Gomer scowls.
1:53 PM	Still glaring, Gomer says, &ldquo;I was wondering why we only have Macs in heaven, that's all,&rdquo; as she steers oikish Hosea toward the food.
1:57 PM	I follow them to the table where Job stuffing himself. &ldquo;Hey, Buddy,&rdquo; says Job, &ldquo;be a good Samaritan and pass the latkes will you?&rdquo;
4:48 PM	Ezekiel ladling soup as in Ezekiel chapter 24. &ldquo;My own recipe!&rdquo; he declares proudly. &ldquo;No scum!&rdquo;
4:48 PM	Solomon staying with flagons, comforting with apples. Lot manning condiments table. &ldquo;Salt, anyone?&rdquo;
4:50 PM	LOT? What's HE doing here?!
4:51 PM	What about offering virgin daughters to townsfolk for rape, drunken incest with daughters and other unpleasantness of Genesis 19?
4:52 PM	I ask Lot about scandal.
4:53 PM	&ldquo;If I had a dime for every time &mdash; listen, I panicked, all right? I'd been drinking &mdash; you know how I get &mdash; can't even recognize my own kids for Chr
4:54 PM	Lot defensive. &ldquo;Oy! God approved, my friend, that's why he spared us. Well, not my wife &mdash; she got turned into a spice. A spice girl &mdash; get it?&rdquo;
4:54 PM	&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; continues Lot, &ldquo;read 2nd Peter &mdash; I'm a good man, just like...&rdquo; (looks around for good man...has trouble finding one handy...)
4:58 PM	&ldquo;...just like Saint Vladimir here,&rdquo; he says, grabbing St Vlad around the neck and play-punching.
4:59 PM	&ldquo;Ya, me good one,&rdquo; says St Vladimir in a thick Russian accent.
5:00 PM	&ldquo;Me Viking warrior &mdash; marauding, slaughtering &mdash; kill brother for to rule Kiev, get hundreds of concubines, wives, not by ask but by force...&rdquo;
5:00 PM	&ldquo;...then decide to be Christian for politics,&rdquo; Vlad continues, &ldquo;get baptized, make everybody in Kiev get baptized &mdash; and they make me Saint!&rdquo;
5:01 PM	&ldquo;Me! Saint!&rdquo; cries St Vladimir, laughing and slapping his big round belly. &ldquo;Ha! That good one, ya?&rdquo;
5:08 PM	Odd bunch here. Everyone from Adam to Zappa. Yes, Frank Zappa in heaven &mdash; as punishment for &ldquo;Jesus Thinks You're a Jerk&rdquo; etc., etc., etc.
5:14 PM	Jesus working the crowd. &ldquo;Hey, do you know the one that ends &lsquo;Peter! I can see my house from here!&rsquo; No? O.K. I'm on the cross and...&rdquo;
5:16 PM	Not hungry or thirsty but drink 12-kind-fruit-punch, eat slice bamanna cream pie.
5:17 PM	Satiation of desires brings pleasure. Again: what if no desire? Answer becoming obvious. (Not painfully obvious as no pain.)
5:18 PM	More details of Welcome Party later. Time for egg and spoon race, crow-eating contest, then three-legged race...
5:19 PM	...looking very good for me, as paired with Terry Fox. (YES!!!)
