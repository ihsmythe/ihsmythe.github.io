Saturday May 30th
7:53 AM	Victory in three-legged race! Tough slog, mind &mdash; John the Baptist shooting for the eyes with water pistol, Dorcas lobbing pin cushions...
7:53 AM	...Samson taking out competitors with jawbone of ass, martyrs using own dismembered limbs, heads like bowling balls to trip up competitors.
7:54 AM	Still, victory! Judge Solomon dispenses medals, certificates. But...gasp! Unfairly awarded silver!
7:55 AM	&ldquo;Ah, sorry &mdash; the race is not to the swift,&rdquo; says Solomon, quoting himself.
7:55 AM	So who takes first? Jesus and Holy Ghost (Sonny and Boo). Feel unfair since Holy Spirit amorphous mass technically without legs at all.
7:56 AM	I complain to Jesus. &ldquo;Hey, blessed are the MEEK, Buster,&rdquo; replies the Lord in reprimanding tone, hitting nose with rolled up certificate.
7:57 AM	Won't protest result further &mdash; remember Numbers 16 in which Israelites complained that God was smiting them, and God replied by smiting them.
8:54 AM	Will console self with various exhibits. First up, Wilgefortis, the original bearded lady.
8:54 AM	Didn't want to marry, so God gave her beard &mdash; and, as a bonus, freak-show employment
9:02 AM	Hmm. Beard or no beard, not sure anyone would have married Wilgefortis. 1st, name. 2nd, drooling. 3rd, could have doubled as fat lady.
9:03 AM	See the Giant! sign says. Expecting Goliath, ho hum. Instead...
9:03 AM	...Andr&eacute;! Wow! Never met actor, i.e. REAL celebrity before. Shook hands &mdash; like shaking a bunch of bratwurst.
9:21 AM	Next up, midget's tent. Basically the cast from The Wizard of Oz. Also Judas Iscariot.
9:30 AM	Funny, the Bible never says Judas was a dwarf, needed step-ladder to kiss Christ on cheek. And what about that speech impediment?
9:31 AM	Betrayal Of Christ somewhat less dramatic if carried out by human equivalent of Donald Duck?
9:39 AM	Next martyr's tent &mdash; displaying wounds, missing body parts, stigmata, various lines of skin and hair-care products, etc.
10:26 AM	Joan of Arc (still smoking by the way) shooting arrows at St Sebastian, purely for entertainment purposes.
10:27 AM	Attempting to miss but appalling shot. St Sebastian riddled with arrows. &ldquo;He was like that before I started,&rdquo; Joan explains.
10:28 AM	&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; says Sebastian. &ldquo;I always wear my arrows, me. &lsquo;Course I take &lsquo;em out before bed...
10:28 AM	...'cause I hate it when they break off under the skin. The Lord gave me special tongs to get &lsquo;em out but...what a nuisance!&rdquo;
11:49 AM	Jesus doing party trick, the one where He walks on water. Not impressed as have seen hobbit-sized feet. I say big hairy deal.
11:56 AM	Watching kiddies playing in inflatable Noah's ark...
11:56 AM	...Noah walks by, says, &ldquo;Jesus! It would've been a hell of a lot easier if I could've just blown the damn thing up.&rdquo;
12:37 PM	Also inflatable tower of Babel, inflatable Sodom and Gomorrah Fun House (for the teens)...
12:38 PM	... and life-sized inflatable Mount Sinai. (Sign: &ldquo;No crampons please!&rdquo;)
6:23 PM	Currently lost in corn maze. Not really corn, of course &mdash; gold spun to look like corn. Still, seemingly no way out. Metaphor for afterlife.
