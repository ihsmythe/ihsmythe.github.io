Monday June 1st
1:34 PM	Am surprised to find myself still trapped in the land of the living dead (heaven) as throwing self off roof had no effect.
1:34 PM	Threw self under several passing buses, swallowed handfuls of diamonds, whacked head repeatedly on marble counter top. Revelation 21:4...
1:35 PM	<I>&ldquo;And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.&rdquo;</I>
1:36 PM	Impasse. Can't kill self as have spiritual body. Wounds heal instantly, hacked off limbs grow back &mdash; have even regrown head.
1:37 PM	Death is TOTAL amputation.
4:05 PM	Have been Resting In Peace after recent suicide attempts. Hanging, stabbing, choking, drowning, strangling, bleeding, jumping, shooting...
4:05 PM	...overeating, under-eating, poisoning, smoking, burning, beheading, overdose, under-dose, electrocution, scorpions, vipers, lions...
4:06 PM	...but no luck. Not a scratch on me and still trapped in the sweet hereafter.
5:00 PM	At least bed comfy. 10,000-thread-count, &ldquo;Ostentatious Opulence Collection.&rdquo; Sticker on headboard: &ldquo;Ex Nihilo Furniture and Supply Company.&rdquo;
5:53 PM	Mother phones. &ldquo;Oh there you are, Mister Morbid, cutting his own head off in the front yard where all the neighbours can see, I'm your
5:53 PM	mother, how do you think it makes me look when you dismember yourself on the front lawn just like your good-for-nothing Father did when he
5:53 PM	found out I was pregnant with you and then after I backed over him with the car he embarrassed me by leaving me for that nurse just like...&rdquo;
5:54 PM	Hang up phone. Look out window, see Mother on phone looking back at me, still talking. Jesus help me.
