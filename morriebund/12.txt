Thursday May 28th
9:08 AM	Finally off the looney bus and at new eternal home. &ldquo;Mansion&rdquo; a slight overstatement...
9:09 AM	...more like single family detached in gigantic gated community &mdash; but NOT complaining. Heaven forbid.
9:10 AM	Basket from Welcome Wagon in vestibule...
9:10 AM	...Milk, honey (unnecessary as flows past house) bottled water which turns into wine, manna, &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; loaves and fishes for entertaining.
9:12 AM	Also invitation to &ldquo;Marriage Supper of the Lamb.&rdquo; No date given. Detect problem with eternity, lack of day/night cycle &mdash; how to tell time?
9:15 AM	Answer found in pamphlet: &ldquo;YOU don't tell TIME &mdash; TIME tells YOU!&rdquo; Apparently citizens of heaven just know when It's Time and are ready.
9:16 AM	How? Just a bit spooky. Do not remember receiving implant in head.
10:18 AM	Inspecting house. Den has TV with a trillion channels. All reruns: Touched By An Angel, Teletubbies, 700 Club. No CSI, House etc. Unholy.
10:30 AM	Cannot &ldquo;watch a little TV&rdquo; because TV size of entire wall. Tiny Po 15 feet tall. Tinky Winky terrifying. Am channel surfing on tsunami.
10:35 AM	Found basket of blank Thank You cards in kitchen (on rare earth kitchen counter with cultured pearl inlay). All pre-addressed...
10:36 AM	...from me to Jesus. Just need to sign, add personal touch. Should probably whip one off now, then post. What to write?
10:37 AM	&ldquo;Dear Jesus: Thanks for super house, dying for sins, etc. BTW, any chance of Special Someone arriving soon? Your Hostage (KIDDING!), Morrie&rdquo;
1:03 PM	Cannot understand why toilet not plumbed in. Wish to call plumber. Where is phone?
1:04 PM	Found solid peridot phone on lapis lazuli table. Looking up area code for heaven. &ldquo;Dial &pi;.&rdquo; (!!!)
1:05 PM	Ah, one button on phone is &pi; &mdash; dials infinite series in seconds. Real time-saver.
1:06 PM	Call Plumb Bob, ask him to come in timely fashion. Says cannot be timely, since no time.
1:06 PM	On Earth used to say something &ldquo;could take forever,&rdquo; but nothing does. However, Plumb Bob could take forever, literally. Use neighbour's WC?
1:43 PM	Aha! I remember to put in phone call to St Peter. &ldquo;Listen, Pete, I need you to check the Book of Life for a name.&rdquo;
1:44 PM	&ldquo;I'm a busy man, Bund,&rdquo; says Peter. I hear paper shuffling, rubber stamping, cock crowing 3 times. (&ldquo;Stupid clock,&rdquo; Peter spits into phone.)
1:44 PM	Also hear female voice. &ldquo;Come, Peter!&rdquo; she says, seductively. &ldquo;Come on, Honeybun, please?&rdquo; Peter replies impatiently. &ldquo;Not now, Gomer!&rdquo;
1:44 PM	&ldquo;Gomer? Who's Gomer?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Nobody you need to mention to anyone else,&rdquo; says Peter, nervously. &ldquo;Especially not to Hosea, right?&rdquo;
1:45 PM	&ldquo;Why shouldn't I mention Gomer?&rdquo; I ask innocently, but slightly menacingly, in a bank-manager-smelling-blood-in-the-water sort of way .
1:45 PM	&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; Peter shouts. &ldquo;I don't like it, Bund &mdash; it's not standard procedure but, just this once. What name?&rdquo;
1:46 PM	&ldquo;Huberman,&rdquo; I hiss into the mouthpiece.
1:46 PM	&ldquo;Huberman?&rdquo; asks Peter, incredulous. &ldquo;You can't be serious. You mean THE Huberman? With the great hair and the charisma and...&rdquo;
1:46 PM	&ldquo;Yes, damn it, THAT Huberman!&rdquo;
1:47 PM	&ldquo;Well of course he's in the book!&rdquo; cries Peter. &ldquo;You're talking about HUBERMAN for heaven's sake! Huberman the &Uuml;berman we call him &mdash; &rdquo;
1:47 PM	&ldquo;Could you just LOOK?&rdquo; I interject.
1:48 PM	All right, fine &mdash; hmm &mdash; Huang, Huang, Huang, Huang, Huang, Huang, Huang, Huang, Huang, Hubble, Huber, Hubert &mdash; well I'll be damned &mdash; NO Huberman!&rdquo;
1:49 PM	&ldquo;Actually &mdash; HE'LL be damned!&rdquo; I yell throwing the receiver down. Yes! Huberman's going to hell! Hallelujah! Praise Jesus! God is VERY good!
1:50 PM	Wait! What about my Judy? Call Peter back, beg for info. &ldquo;No can do,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;Gomer or no Gomer, one name only.&rdquo; Slams down the phone.
1:50 PM	Disappointed &mdash; wanted definite answer &mdash; relying on eternal vengeance fantasy re: Huberman AND eternal honeymoon fantasy re: Judy.
1:51 PM	Still, how could God NOT allow His most beautiful creature into heaven? Just hope God doesn't try to set Judy up with Jesus. Humph.
3:52 PM	Someone outside front door. I imagine for a moment that it might be Judy. Find myself humming &ldquo;Heaven must be missing an angel...&rdquo;
3:53 PM	Letter delivered by Post-angel Pat to mail box (solid ammolite)...
3:53 PM	...Epistle from Paul. Wages of sin, justification by faith, gift of tongues, plus party invitation welcoming newbies. Potluck.
