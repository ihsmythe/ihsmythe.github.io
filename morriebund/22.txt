Sunday June 7th
7:01 AM	Completely over the moon about Judy, though sorry about being a teensy bit responsible for her premature death.
7:06 AM	Huberman's probably weeping over her cold dead body right now. Ha!
7:08 AM	Should possibly feel guilty, but point is that I can give Judy so much more here, in paradise, than Huberman could ever give her on Earth.
7:10 AM	After all, heaven jam-packed with precious riches. Moonstone microwave, tourmaline toaster, spodumene sponge bag just the beginning!
7:13 AM	For instance, I can give Judy MILLIONS of new &ldquo;best friends&rdquo;, if diamonds are as advertised! Ha! How do you like THEM apples, Huberman!?
8:02 AM	Decide to go for a jog, run into Saint Peter again, remember to ask about &ldquo;Marriage Supper of the Lamb&rdquo;.
8:02 AM	&ldquo;So who's getting married?&rdquo; I ask, taking a swig of holy water.
8:02 AM	&ldquo;Silly,&rdquo; says St Peter. &ldquo;You are.&rdquo;
8:03 AM	I choke, water spraying everywhere. &ldquo;What did you say? You mean, I get to be married?&rdquo; Suddenly heaven looking a lot more attractive.
8:03 AM	&ldquo;Of course you do,&rdquo; replies Peter. &ldquo;Well that's bloody fantastic!&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;I get to marry Judy, right? I mean &mdash; who do I marry? Who is she?&rdquo;
8:04 AM	&ldquo;She?&rdquo; asks Peter. &ldquo;She? SHE? Oh no, no, no. You're not marrying a woman.&rdquo;
8:04 AM	&ldquo;What do you mean I'm NOT MARRYING A WOMAN?&rdquo;
8:04 AM	&ldquo;You're marrying a lamb,&rdquo; Peter explains. &ldquo;You know, THE Lamb &mdash; of God &mdash; aka Jesus. Didn't you know?&rdquo;
8:04 AM	I grab my chest and fight for air. &ldquo;Oh come now,&rdquo; says Peter. &ldquo;Every man is naturally a little nervous when he finds out he's a bride...
8:05 AM	...because he doesn't know what it's going to be like...
8:05 AM	...will I get pregnant? Will He bring home a disease? Will it hurt? Just the sort of question all brides have.&rdquo;
8:06 AM	&ldquo;No, oh God, no!&rdquo; I say, closing my eyes and collapsing onto the golden sidewalk. It's then I hear sniggering.
8:06 AM	&ldquo;I really had you going there, didn't I?&rdquo; says Peter.
8:07 AM	I open my eyes, see Peter smiling smugly. &ldquo;Sorry, but it gets a little dull around here sometimes.&rdquo;
8:07 AM	&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; I say. &ldquo;So &mdash; you mean I'm not getting married to a &mdash; a man?&rdquo; I ask, relieved. &ldquo;I get to marry Judy after all?&rdquo;
8:07 AM	Peter laughs. &ldquo;Silly! Of course you're marrying a man. You're marrying the Son of God, just like everybody else. It's standard procedure.
8:08 AM	Doesn't anybody read their Bibles anymore?&rdquo; asks Peter, exasperated. &ldquo;It's all there AND in your Welcome to Heaven brochure.
8:08 AM	Second Corinthians 11:2  &mdash; 
8:08 AM	<I>I am jealous over you with godly jealousy, for I have betrothed you to one husband, that I may present YOU as a chaste virgin to Christ.&rdquo;</I>
8:08 AM	&ldquo;But JUDY'S coming to heaven!&rdquo; I cry. &ldquo;I want to marry Judy!&rdquo;
8:09 AM	&ldquo;Well you and Judy can marry Him together if you like. Anyway, your garter belt's in the closet. Toodles!&rdquo;
