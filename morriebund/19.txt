Thursday June 4th
8:36 AM	Doorbell rings. Amazed to find Mormon Elders &mdash; two boys who look like they wouldn't yet have hair on their testicles, if they had testicles.
8:36 AM	&ldquo;You mean there are Mormons living in heaven?&rdquo; I ask, incredulous. &ldquo;Oh we don't live in THIS heaven,&rdquo; Elder Tim replies.
8:37 AM	&ldquo;We have our own heaven, where men are Gods. They have their own planets and hundreds of wives and they procreate for all eternity.&rdquo;
8:40 AM	&ldquo;Oh good Lord!&rdquo; I exclaim, falling to my knees voluntarily for a change. &ldquo;Take me with you! Sweet mother of God, please, take me with you!&rdquo;
8:41 AM	&ldquo;No can do,&rdquo; replies Elder Dwayne. &ldquo;Unless...
8:41 AM	...you weren't sealed in a secret Mormon Temple ritual by any chance?&rdquo; I shake my head forlornly. &ldquo;Aw. Sorry Buddy.&rdquo;
8:42 AM	&ldquo;Well &mdash; what are YOU doing here?&rdquo; I ask. &ldquo;Oh, you know,&rdquo; says Elder Dwayne, adjusting his tie. &ldquo;Old habits die hard. Would you like a tract?&rdquo;
8:42 AM	&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; whispers Elder Tim, &ldquo;Mormon heaven's not really all it's cracked up to be. All those women...
8:42 AM	...well, they're pregnant most of the time. The mood swings, the heartburn, the swollen ankles....They get a little cranky, you know?&rdquo;
8:43 AM	&ldquo;And managing a planet isn't exactly easy,&rdquo; adds Elder Dwayne, &ldquo;especially a planet full of women who are mad as hell.&rdquo;
8:43 AM	&ldquo;You got that right,&rdquo; adds Elder Tim, shivering.
8:47 AM	&ldquo;Trust me, you're better off here,&rdquo; says Dwayne. &ldquo;That's really why we come here &mdash; to get away from all the screaming &mdash; the kids, the men...&rdquo;
8:48 AM	&ldquo;And from all those bloated women with spit-up stains all down their blouses,&rdquo; adds Elder Tim, looking haunted.
8:50 AM	&ldquo;At least with all those other wives around they've got loads of help with the housework,&rdquo; says Elder Dwayne.
8:51 AM	&ldquo;Not like a man/god,&rdquo; says Tim. &ldquo;I mean &mdash; a planet's a pretty big thing to mow.&rdquo;
9:04 AM	Eventually I slam the door in Elder Tim and Elder Dwayne's faces (still the only tried and true method of getting rid of missionaries).
9:05 AM	Can't shake the belief that Mormon heaven sounds better than this one &mdash; will request transfer.
9:06 AM	Phoning God. Get answering machine with perky female voice...
9:06 AM	&ldquo;You've reached the voice mail of (switch to the voice of God) THE ALMIGHTY.&rdquo; Back to female voice: &ldquo;Your call is very important to...
9:07 AM	...(back to the voice of God) THE ALMIGHTY (back to female voice) so please leave a brief message after the sounding trumpet.&rdquo; Toot!
9:07 AM	&ldquo;Yes, hello God, this is Morrie &mdash; Morrie Bund. Listen...
9:07 AM	...I was wondering if &mdash; &rdquo; &ldquo;IF you are happy with your message, press one now,&rdquo; says the perky answering machine voice.
9:08 AM	&ldquo;If you are not happy with your message, press the number of the beast. Your call will be forwarded. Thank you, and have a nice eternity.&rdquo;
9:16 AM	Humph. Will ask St Peter about transfer to Mormon heaven. Meanwhile will order Chinese from Huang's Heavenly House of Hoisin...
9:18 AM	...then watch The Waltons followed by Hymn Time with special guest Tennessee Ernie Ford. In heaven, it just doesn't get any better.
9:18 AM	No wait, it does &mdash; there are two surprise guests performing as one act &mdash; Hildegaard of Bingen Crosby. God help. Please, God help.
