8:30 AM	Still on bus. Slept, ate egg salad sandwich, even though totally unnecessary. Deeply confused upon awakening. Thought I was in hell.
8:48 AM	Radio station still playing oldies like &ldquo;Are You Washed In The Blood?&rdquo; plus new country songs like &ldquo;Washed, Rinsed, and Tumble Dried&rdquo;.
8:49 AM	<I>&ldquo;Washed, rinsed, and tumble dried<br>Jesus Christ fer me He died<br>My life stank like a toilet bowl<br>His type A plus cleansed up my soul!<br>Yeeha!&rdquo;</I>
9:00 AM	Looking wistfully out window. Landscape flat, repetitive, like Looney Tunes background: mansion, park, church, mansion, park church, mansion
9:01 AM	Jesus said, &ldquo;I go to prepare a place for you.&rdquo; Unfinished mansions all over the place. Typical builder...
9:01 AM	...never finishes one project before starting another.
1:45 PM	Passing large mansion with wrecking ball, gem rubble, gold dust everywhere. Sign says, &ldquo;Former Future Mansion of Michael Shermer.&rdquo; Ah.
