        There are literally millions of books written <i>about</i> animals, but only two books written specifically
        <I>for</I> animals &ndash; and this is one of them.* Originally these stories were published on the wind as an
        olfactory collection for dogs, but when they soared to #1 on the bestseller lists, other creatures demanded
        versions for themselves. Thus they were published with vegetable based inks for the edification of rabbits and
        slugs; converted into a vigorous waggle dance for honeybees; transcribed into whale songs, bird calls, cricket
        chirps, and elephant trumpets; and, lastly, translated into cow pies for the satisfaction of dung beetles and
        houseflies. All of these animals enjoyed reading about phobic cats, skeptical basset hounds, heroic honeybees,
        tree-hugging slugs, and megalomaniacal mollusks &ndash; but now, at long last, <i>Stories for Animals</i> is
        available to animals of all species &ndash; including yours.
