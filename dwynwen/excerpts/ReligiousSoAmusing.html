          at all naughtiness they scoff,

        <DD>
          then they’ll prob’ly whack it off.
        </DD>

        <DD>
          and people up on crosses.

        <DT>
          Sometimes they ring my doorbell,

        <DD>
          then beneath my bed I hustle,
        </DD>
        <DT>
          And stroke my little Darwin fish

        <DD>
          to tacos shaped like Mary.

          Bedfellows, ne’er! With unbelief

          a celestial party pooper.
