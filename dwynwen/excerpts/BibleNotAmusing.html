        <h3>Experts Prove Not One Even Remotely Amusing Thing in Entire Bible</h3>
          <P>
            Mount Sinai, Egypt &ndash; A government-appointed committee of humourologists from around the globe claim to have proven that, as a work of comedy, The Holy Bible is a catastrophic failure.
          </P>
          <P>
            &ldquo;There are 791,328 words and not a gag, a pun, or a wisecrack among them,&rdquo; commented Rabbi Henny Whoopeecushion of the Holy Land. &ldquo;Who could write that much material and not even accidentally say something that might produce a chuckle? The odds are against it, which, of course, adds further proof of His existence &ndash; only a divine entity could be that unremittingly not funny.&rdquo;
          </P>
          <P>
            &ldquo;God wrote the Holy Scriptures after the Fall &ndash; but before the summer,&rdquo; explains Biblical expert Eleazar Funstein. &ldquo;Ha! A little joke! Actually, in all seriousness here, folks, God wrote the Bible before the invention of humour. If God were writing the scriptures today, the Bible would be a very different book. Sort of like, â€˜In the beginning was the word, and the word was followed by ba-dum bum.&rsquo;&rdquo;

            Other experts disagree with the findings of the committee. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s face it &ndash; the whole Bible is just a joke from beginning to end,&rdquo; says dogmatic atheist Rex Schnauzer, &ldquo;especially when you take into account the fact that the tall tale genre was the highest form of humour before the Enlightenment. Noah&rsquo;s Ark, Jonah and the Whale, Joshua and the Battle of Jericho, David and Goliath &ndash; these were the sort of yarns that kept the comedy clubs of Nineveh hopping in 3 BC.&rdquo;
          </P>
          <P>
            &ldquo;Actually the Bible is a masterpiece of satire and is without a doubt the funniest book ever written,&rdquo; continues Mr. Schnauzer. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t read a verse like, say, Judges 4:21 without ending up with tears streaming down your face, pounding the floor with your fists and gasping for air &ndash; it&rsquo;s that goddamn funny.&rdquo;
          </P>
          <P>
            Other experts contend that the humour issue is impossible to resolve because the Hebrews are a preternaturally patient people and are used to waiting centuries, even millennia, for a punch line. As if to emphasize the point, Rabbi Whoopeecushion vows that a Pentateuchical Comedyfest will be held next year in Jerusalem.
