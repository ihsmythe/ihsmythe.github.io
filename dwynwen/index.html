        Oliver Black is a restaurant critic and exuberantly moral family man. Father to an eight-year-old vegan warrior
        princess with her own animal rescue service and three hulking teenage boys whose purpose in life is to convert
        bananas into testosterone, Oliver has his hands full.
      </P>
      <P>
        Oliver&rsquo;s wife, Lucy, is an ambitious artist with a secret, although given that Oliver corresponds
        regularly with a blackmailer while his brother constantly runs from the police, it would seem that Lucy is not
        the only one with a clandestine life. It is Oliver who first introduces us to Rafe Wilde, a music critic and
        playboy manqu&eacute; who boasts big secrets and even bigger troubles. When Rafe&rsquo;s current and former
        girlfriends both refuse to sleep with him and he is forced to endure Oliver&rsquo;s relentless criticism of his
        taste in music and women, Rafe is driven to distraction. But when his irritation turns into hostility and his
        hostility turns into hatred, Rafe becomes hell-bent on revenge.
      </P>
      <P>
        Dwynwen&rsquo;s Feast merrily transports souls hungry for humour on a full-course satirical romp through music,
        art, philosophy, religion, cats, critics, beds, and bananas.
      </P>
