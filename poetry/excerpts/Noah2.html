            And sometimes crates of brutes
            <br>
            Would rip each other limb from limb,
            <br>
            And then they'd look at Noah, bust the crate,
            <br>
            And go for him!
            <br>
            Or sometimes it was peckish Noah, like some wild boar,
            <br>
            Who'd polish off the creatures, and be forced to go get more.
            <br>
            Plus it wasn't easy telling animals apart,
            <br>
            At least two thousand kinds of kindred rodents for a start!
            <br>
            Forty thousand spiders!
            <br>
            Eighty thousand snails and slugs!
            <br>
            Sixty thousand vertebrates!
            <br>
            A million kinds of bugs!
            <br>
            As much as thirty million species over all the planet,
            <br>
            But Noah soldiered on, with heart of gold and will of granite.
          </P>
          <P>
            Shoebills, spoonbills, thorny devils, kangaroos and gnus!
            <br>
            Eyelash vipers, Jesus lizards, kakapos and shrews!
            <br>
            Beavers, boobies, dinos, dodos, bandicoots and crakes!
            <br>
            Dumbo rats, chinchillas, woodchucks, unicorns and snakes!
          </P>
          <P>
            And oh! the things that Noah had to know a lot about,
            <br>
            Like how to tell a grizzly from a black bear by its snout!
            <br>
            And how to tell the difference between eighty breeds of cat,
            <br>
            And how to tell a wombat by its cubic wombat scat.
            <br>
            Koala bears eat leaves, he learned, but never eat the bark,
            <br>
            And as for tapeworms, squeamish Noah had to <I>be</I> the ark!
            <br>
            Still even though he had to know as much as his creator,
            <br>
            As huge as all his learning was, the danger was yet greater!
          </P>

          <P>
            He had to capture vampire bats in guano-slicked abodes!
            <br>
            He had to know that suicidal ants will just explode!
            <br>
            He had to capture cheetahs
            <br>
            And get leashes 'round their necks!
            <br>
            He had to flip o'er hippos to identify their sex!
            <br>
            And just when Noah thought he must be done
            <br>
            Then God would say,
            <br>
            "Not yet&mdash;you've missed an aphid,
            <br>
            On a leaf,
            <br>
            In Paraguay."
          </P>
          <P>
            Pythons, pufflegs, fruitbats, meerkats,
            <br>
            Penguins, blue-tongued skinks!
            <br>
            Turkeys, turtles, Fairy armadillos, Manx and minks!
            <br>
            Crocs, okapis, cockatoos and Red-necked Phalaropes!
            <br>
            Pronghorns, pandas, gobies, yetis, Bongo antelopes!
          </P>
          <P>
            How happy Noah must have been with every beast aboard,
            <br>
            Sailing o'er the flooded Earth, a rainbow as reward.
            <br>
            And of three hundred kinds of dove,
            <br>
            He threw one off the boat,
            <br>
            To look for land (amongst the billion corpses now afloat),
            <br>
            And when the dove did not return,
            <br>
            He knew he'd found the shore!
            <br>
            But when the shore turned out to be
            <br>
            A mountain, Noah swore!
            <br>
            Oh why did God deposit him at twenty thousand feet,
            <br>
            Without a carabiner, or a crampon, or a cleat?
