          <P>
            There was a man named Noah who was pious as you please,
            <br>
            And meeker than a kitten, and holier than Swiss cheese,
            <br>
            As upright as a mountain, as lowly as a pebble,
            <br>
            So sheepish that he made a sheep look like a lawless rebel,
            <br>
            A veritable teacher's pet, and requisite soft touch,
            <br>
            The perfect choice for gath'ring beasts,
            <br>
            And building arks and such.
            <br>
            And so God said to Noah, "Son, this is your lucky day.
            <br>
            I'm going to drown all living things, except for you&mdash;hooray!
            <br>
            There're just three things you need to do,
            <br>
            You'd best begin this minute;
            <br>
            Collect two of each species,
            <br>
            Build an ark,
            <br>
            And put them in it."
            <br>
            And Noah started sweating,
            <br>
            And his thoughts convulsed and swirled,
            <br>
            And God said, "It won't be that bad, it's just one little world!"
            <br>
            "But God," said Noah, "you know me, I'm not a man to fuss,
            <br>
            It's just that I've got allergies to cats and bee stings, plus
            <br>
            I'm six hundred years old," he argued, as it started raining,
            <br>
            And God said, "I'm <em>eternal</em>, but you don't hear me complaining.
            <br>
            Just think of all the travel! The adventure and the fun!
            <br>
            Now get to work, my devotee, and call me when you're done."
            <br>
            So Noah, heavyhearted, built an ark of wood and glue,
            <br>
            Then started catching creatures for his massive floating zoo.

            Oh, pity Noah! with the Earth to circumnavigate,
            <br>
            Dressed in a safari suit, his pockets stuffed with bait,
            <br>
            Travelling the world upon a horse like Don Quixote,
            <br>
            Setting sneaky Acme traps, like Wile E. Coyote,
            <br>
            Scampering through meadows, butterfly net in his hand,
            <br>
            Belly-flopping on his prey, in water, and on land,
            <br>
            Tempting rodents into traps with little bits of cheese,
            <br>
            Running scared from scorpions, and bulls, and killer bees,
            <br>
            Pussyfooting into caves, and scrabbling in the mud,
            <br>
            Looking under every stone, in every flower bud,
            <br>
            Searching every crevice, every pond and bit of sludge,
            <br>
            For animals of every stripe, and spot and swirl and smudge!
          </P>
          <P>
            Bilbies, dik-diks, kakas, cranes and kinkajous and coots!
            <br>
            Aye-ayes, drongos, fossas, Turkens, porcupines and newts!
            <br>
            Wombats, dippers, Whiskered Flowerpeckers,
            <br>
            Snipes and stoats!
            <br>
            Smelts and smews and wolverines
            <br>
            And auks and yaks and shoats!
          </P>
          <P>
            Noah searched the whole world o'er
            <br>
            For life in every form,
            <br>
            And at a time when transport trucks
            <br>
            And planes were not the norm!
            <br>
            To get a box of dingos, say,
            <br>
            He'd go by foot and skiff,
            <br>
            But that meant months of travel home,
            <br>
            At which point they'd be stiff!
