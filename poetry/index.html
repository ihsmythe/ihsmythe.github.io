      <P>
        There are millions of books written <i>about</i> animals, but only two books in the world written specifically
        <i>for</i> animals &ndash; and the book <I>Poetry for Animals</I> is one of them.* Of course you may find that
        when you read these poems to an animal it will look surprised and uncomprehending, but this is not because the
        animal doesn&rsquo;t understand what you are saying. It is merely because no one has ever taken the trouble to
        read to it before, and it will only be a matter of time before the animal you are reading to will express its
        pleasure by purring in your lap, or cavorting gaily about its enclosure, or by gnawing on your skull, or by
        flying away never to be seen again. Focus-group studies have shown, however, that it is members of <i>your</i>
        species who tend actually to buy and read books of poems, thus this collection was written specifically with
        <i>you</i> in mind.
