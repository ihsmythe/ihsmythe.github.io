            <p><cite>It is difficult to get the news from poems, yet men and women die miserably every day for lack of what is found there.*</cite></p>
            <p>I believe that's true, which is why I'm delighted to be the one to offer up these poems (and lyrics) from this new album, <a href="order.html"><I>Like a Tide Rising</I></a>. Here the enigmatic writer Los Haward gives us a dazzling selection of his work that's alternately reverent, irreverent, gut-wrenchingly sad, explosively joyous, pessimistic, optimistic, funny, and tragic&mdash;sometimes all in the same poem. His work is so evocative, insightful, and inspiring it quite literally made me sing&mdash;and I couldn't believe my luck when he told me that I could do anything I wanted with it. And so I did. I made this album. Twenty pieces of music crafted around his words (either sung or read, depending) and an additional thirty poems, read by the poet himself in his expressive, sagacious, sensual way. (So far, no one I know who's heard him can figure out why on earth he's not a voice actor, but that's just another of life's great mysteries.)</p>
