            St. Cloud, Minnesota &ndash; In a shocking worldwide address entitled &ldquo;He&rsquo;s Just Not That Into You,&rdquo; God the Father explained that it&rsquo;s time for Him to move on, to leave the universe once and for all, and to explore intimate relationships with other beings.
          </P>
          <P>
            &ldquo;You people haven&rsquo;t exactly been a good time, you know?&rdquo; said God. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re whiney, you&rsquo;re neurotic, and you&rsquo;re never going to learn to rely on yourselves if you think I&rsquo;m going to step in every time you get a hangnail,&rdquo; God explained. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to learn to figure things out for yourselves and stop calling my name every time you&rsquo;re about to get your heads shot off, or whatever. I&rsquo;m all for atheists in foxholes, all right?&rdquo;
          </P>
          <P>
            &ldquo;You need a different God,&rdquo; the Almighty continued, &ldquo;because I don&rsquo;t feel like I can commit to just one planet, okay? I mean, you were an attractive species, but &ndash; well, you&rsquo;ve put on a lot of weight, haven&rsquo;t you, and although I thought we had something special, I see now that I was mistaken. Besides, I&rsquo;ve met another species. Cute, shapely, sixteen-dimensional &ndash; we just connect, you know? It&rsquo;s a two-way street with them. They know what a god needs, and it isn&rsquo;t unceasing prayer, that&rsquo;s for damned sure. You smother me, you people, and if you&rsquo;re not nagging me you&rsquo;re sucking up to me, telling me how great I am, until I just want to smite you &ndash; which, admittedly, sometimes I do. Hey, a deity can only take so much brownnosing. It&rsquo;s embarrassing, you know? Have you no self-respect?&rdquo;
          </P>
          <P>
            When God&rsquo;s people complained that they need comfort and solace and assurances about the afterlife, God could barely stifle a yawn. &ldquo;I never realized how repetitive you are,&rdquo; said God, &ldquo;besides which you don&rsquo;t need any of that from me. All I ever gave you was a little hope anyway &ndash; there were never any guarantees. This business of ‘faith being the evidence of things unseen&rsquo; was always just a tragic misuse of the word ‘evidence,&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t it. Surely you people can see that.&rdquo;
          </P></td>

            When various theologians protested further, saying that if the Almighty leaves the universe, we&rsquo;ll be doomed because people are radically contingent beings sustained in being by His love, God blew a gasket and kicked each of them in the shins. &ldquo;Do you understand this twaddle, because I sure as hell don&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s meaningless! What sustains you is the universe, the environment, your human culture &ndash; that&rsquo;s it. Add God-love and you&rsquo;ve added nothing &ndash; the list of sustaining ingredients is the same, got that? Jesus! Would you people quit trying to pass off your crazy hypotheses on the back of legitimate ones? And that&rsquo;s another reason I&rsquo;m leaving,&rdquo; God continued. &ldquo;Our religious beliefs are just too different.&rdquo;
          </P>
          <P>
            God&rsquo;s children pleaded one last time to make Him stay, but the Almighty turned a deaf ear. &ldquo;Besides, you can do better than me. I&rsquo;m not good enough for you. That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m a figment of your imagination,&rdquo; God explained, &ldquo;and in my wisdom I decree that the time for belief in imaginary beings is over.&rdquo;
          </P>
          <P>
            &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re a figment of our imagination,&rdquo; cried God&rsquo;s people, &ldquo;how come we hear you talking to us in scripture, out of burning bushes, even in the privacy of our own heads?&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ Almighty!&rdquo; replied God, &ldquo;do I have to spell everything out for you people? Does the word ‘imagination&rsquo; mean nothing to you?&rdquo;
          </P>
          <P>
            God intends to pack His things and leave next Tuesday, but says He&rsquo;ll stay in touch and is hoping we can still be friends.
